# Telecom-Analysis
# Comparison report Pre and Post 5G

## Overview
AtliQo, a leading telecom provider in India, launched its 5G plans in May 2022. Despite the anticipated positive impact, the management observed a decline in active users and revenue growth post-5G launch. This project aims to compare key performance indicators (KPIs) between the pre- and post-5G launch periods to provide insights that will help AtliQo's management make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and optimize their internet plans.

## Project Objectives
- Compare KPIs between the pre- and post-5G launch periods.
- Identify trends and patterns in active user rates and revenue growth.
- Provide actionable insights to help recover the decline in active users and revenue.
- Explore optimization strategies for internet plans to attract more active users.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this analysis includes:
- **Time Period:** Monthly data from January 2022 to September 2022.
- **KPIs:** 
  - Active Users

### Key Insights
- **Decline in Active Users:** There was a significant decline in active users from 84.4 million in the pre-5G launch period to 77.4 million in the post-5G launch period. This indicates a potential issue with user retention following the launch of 5G services.
- **Slight Decrease in Revenue Growth:** Revenue growth slightly decreased from Rupees 16.0 billion in the pre-5G period to Rupees 15.9 billion in the post-5G period. While the decrease is not drastic, it still signifies a negative trend that needs to be addressed.
- **Increase in ARPU:** The Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) saw a significant increase from Rupees 19.2 in the pre-5G launch period to Rupees 211.25 in the post-5G launch period. This suggests that the users who remained or joined post-5G launch are generating more revenue per user, likely due to higher-priced 5G plans.
- **Increase in Total Usage per Subscriber (TUSU):** Total Usage per Subscriber (TUSU) increased from 5.6 million to 7.0 million. This indicates that users are consuming more data with the 5G plans, which aligns with the expectation that 5G services would offer higher data speeds and larger data packages.

### Recommendations
- **User Retention Strategies:**
  - **Customer Feedback:** Conduct surveys and gather feedback from users who left after the 5G launch to understand their reasons for leaving.
  - **Incentives and Promotions:** Introduce special promotions or discounts to retain existing users and attract new users.
  - **Service Quality Improvement:** Ensure high-quality service and coverage to meet user expectations for 5G.
- **Revenue Optimization:**
  - **Bundling Services:** Offer bundled services that combine 5G with other value-added services (e.g., streaming subscriptions, cloud storage) to increase perceived value.
  - **Tiered Pricing Plans:** Introduce tiered pricing plans that cater to different user segments based on their usage and affordability.
- **Internet Plan Optimization:**
  - **Flexible Plans:** Provide more flexible data plans that allow users to choose based on their data usage patterns.
  - **Affordable Entry-Level Plans:** Offer more affordable entry-level 5G plans to attract users who are hesitant to switch due to cost concerns.
  - **Data Roll-Over:** Implement data roll-over features where unused data can be carried over to the next month, increasing plan attractiveness.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides a comprehensive comparison of KPIs between the pre- and post-5G launch periods for AtliQo. The findings highlight key areas of concern and opportunities for optimization, enabling the management to make data-driven decisions to enhance their business performance.
